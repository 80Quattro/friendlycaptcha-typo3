This extension integrates the service of **Friendly Captcha** into your site by using the
official API. This version only supports **Friendly Captcha V2**. For **V1** support, please install an earlier version of the plugin.

Currently it supports the following form solutions:

* System extension "form" (`typo3/cms-form`)
* Community extension "powermail" (`in2code/powermail`)

Additionally the extension can be used in your own extensions.
